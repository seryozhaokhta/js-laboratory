## Overview
Your project appears to be a web-based audio visualizer application, with several JavaScript files handling different aspects of the application. The HTML file (`index.html`) likely serves as the main structure for the user interface.

- **AudioController.js**: This script probably manages audio control functionality, like play, pause, and volume adjustments.
- **index.html**: The main HTML document, defining the structure and content of the web page.
- **main.js**: Likely the central JavaScript file that orchestrates various functionalities of the application.
- **TextInteractive.js**: This script might be responsible for interactive text elements on the web page, possibly related to audio tracks or user interactions.
- **Visualizer.js**: This script is likely used for creating visual effects that respond to audio input, a key feature in audio visualizer applications.
- **playIcon.js**: Probably manages the functionality and appearance of the play icon/button in the user interface.
- **resetIconAnimation.js**: Handles the animation and behavior of a reset icon, potentially for resetting the visualizer or other settings.
- **styles.css**: A CSS file (not reviewed) that likely contains the styling rules for your web application's user interface.
